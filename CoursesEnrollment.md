Introduction
===
On April 2017, we were given a project to create an app based on
the datasets. The project is divided into two tasks:
- Create a ~~Shiny app~~ and deploy it on ~~Rstudio's servers~~.
- Use ~~Slidify~~ or ~~Rstudio Presenter~~ and prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about our application.

For our project, we use RStudio for both tasks because we find it'is more efficient.

What is Courses Enrollment App?
===
Courses Enrollment App provides the best functions to explore the
datasets about Malaysia's Public University Enrollments. The data
include the courses and amount of students who took that courses on the certain year based on university. This app allows user to:

- Choose which university and courses.
- Choose type of observations.
- Read documentations.

We provide the source code (ui.R & server.R) on the Github:

Functions
===
Throughout our application, we implement some functions to present more
informations about the data.
- summary() function provides overall statistics about the data such as
median, mean and maximum number.
- view() and view1() functions show an observation of the data such as data
table and graphs.
- 'graf' interprets the data in a visual way like the plot and ggplot.
